This pattern suggests a left-skewed distribution, in which the majority of the data points are concentrated towards the higher values, with fewer data points extending towards the lower values. However, it is essential to analyze the data visually to determine the distribution and tendency. A histogram is created to analyze the data in the next step.\n","\n","### Step 2: Visualizations\n","\n","As shown in Figure 3, the distribution of sales values is not left-skewed. It appears to be roughly normal, with most of the values falling between 60,000 to 120,000. The histogram is unimodal, and the top 3 bins are 100,000-120,000 (350), 80,000-100,000 (276), and 60,000-80,000 (267). There are also 6 outliers with values greater than 220,000. The gap between these outliers and the nearest value is 37,120. All the outliers are large-sized bird toys.\n","\n","Moreover, to determine if the distribution is truly normal, I input the data into R and performed the Shapiro-Wilk test. The result showed a W value of 0.97012 and a p-value less than 2.2e-16. The W value, which is close to 1, suggests some similarity to a normal distribution. However, the extremely small p-value provides strong evidence against the null hypothesis of normality, indicating that the data in the 'sales' column is not normally distributed.\n","\n","![image-7](image-7.png)\n"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c5fbe3a0-d277-437c-a1a0-f1edf80684f7","metadata":{},"source":["## Task 4\n","1.

Answer for question 1:\n","\n","To investigate the relationship between repeat purchases and sales, a bar chart was first created. As depicted in Figure 4, the total sales volume for products with repeat purchases (\"Yes\") at 81M is significantly larger than that of products without repeat purchases (\"No\") at 56M. This result initially suggests that products with repeat purchases might be more popular among customers, leading to higher total sales volume. Further analysis is needed to confirm this hypothesis.\n","\n","Figure 5, however, presents inconsistent results compared to Figure 4. The whisker area, mean, and median values for the \"No\" category (mean=94395.42, median=102167) are higher than those for the \"Yes\" category (mean=89209.79, median=89650). The higher total sales volume for the \"Yes\" category can be attributed to a larger number of outliers above 150,000. This finding raises questions about the role of repeat purchases in sales volume.\n","\n","To gain more insights, a simple regression test was conducted. The coefficient for repeat_purchase is -5189, indicating that, on average, the sales volume for products with repeat purchases is 5189 units lower than products without repeat purchases. The p-value for the repeat_purchase variable is 0.016, less than the significance level of 0.05, signifying a statistically significant relationship between repeat purchases and sales volume.\n","\n","In conclusion, while there is a statistically significant relationship between repeat purchases and sales volume, other factors such as product price and rating may also impact overall sales volume. Further research should address these factors for a more comprehensive understanding.\n","\n","\n","![image-12](image-12.png)\n","\n","![image-13](image-13.png)"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
